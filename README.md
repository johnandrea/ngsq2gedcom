Convert an NGSQ formatted genealogy report to a GEDCOM file.

The intention is to capture the family structure of the original data. Determination of exact names, partners, dates, etc. is very difficult from the free format or the original PDF.

For this parser the PDF should be converted to CSV via the OCR tools of Amazon AWS Textract: https://aws.amazon.com/textract/
